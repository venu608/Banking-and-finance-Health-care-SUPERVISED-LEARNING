• CONTEXT: Medical research university X is undergoing a deep research on patients with certain conditions.
University has an internal AI team. Due to confidentiality the patient’s details and the conditions are masked by the client by providing different datasets to the AI team for developing a AIML model which can predict the condition of the patient depending on the received test results.

# • DATA DESCRIPTION: The data consists of biomechanics features of the patients according to their current
conditions. Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanics attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the condition to their body part.

P_incidence
P_tilt
L_angle
S_slope
P_radius
S_degree

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate the ability to fetch, process and leverage data to generate useful predictions
by training Supervised Learning algorithms.

Import and warehouse data: • Import all the given datasets and explore shape and size of each. • Merge all datasets onto one and explore final shape and size.

Data cleansing: • Explore and if required correct the datatypes of each attribute • Explore for null values in the attributes and if required drop or impute values.

Data analysis & visualisation: • Perform detailed statistical analysis on the data. • Perform a detailed univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis with appropriate detailed comments after each analysis.

Data pre-processing: • Segregate predictors vs target attributes • Perform normalisation or scaling if required. • Check for target balancing. Add your comments. • Perform train-test split.

Model training, testing and tuning: • Design and train a KNN classifier. • Display the classification accuracies for train and test data. • Display and explain the classification report in detail. • Automate the task of finding best values of K for KNN. • Apply all the possible tuning techniques to train the best model for the given data. Select the final best trained model with your comments for selecting this model.

Conclusion and improvisation: • Write your conclusion on the results. • Detailed suggestions or improvements or on quality, quantity, variety, velocity, veracity etc. on the data points collected by the research team to perform a better data analysis in future.
